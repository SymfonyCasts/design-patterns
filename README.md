# Design Patterns for Fun and Proficiency in Symfony! 

Well hi there! This repository holds the code and script
for the [Design Patterns for Fun and Proficiency Tutorials](https://symfonycasts.com/screencast/design-patterns) on SymfonyCasts.

## Setup

If you've just downloaded the code, congratulations!!

To get it working, follow these steps:

**Download Composer dependencies**

Make sure you have [Composer installed](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
and then run:

```
composer install
```

You may alternatively need to run `php composer.phar install`, depending
on how you installed Composer.

**Running the App!**

This is a command-line only app - so no web server needed. Instead, run:

```
php bin/console app:game:play
```

Have fun and battle hard!

## Have Ideas, Feedback or an Issue?

If you have suggestions or questions, please feel free to
open an issue on this repository or comment on the course
itself. We're watching both :).

## Thanks!

And as always, thanks so much for your support and letting
us do what we love!

<3 Your friends at SymfonyCasts
